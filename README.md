# Refactoring of the Real Estate Agency Site

The initial site `index.html` was validated with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) as well as its performance was checked with [YSlow](http://yslow.org/) to receive an overall grade A. Also the map used improperly in the script was fixed.

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
